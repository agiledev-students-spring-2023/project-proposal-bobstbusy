# Bobstometer

# What and why?
A simple webapp to report and check how busy parts of Bobst are (individual floors, reading rooms, etc.) so that students can find seats without walking through the whole library

# For whom?
For students who want to study in Bobst without spending half an hour trying to find an open seat

# How?
Students can crowd-source data by voluntarily reporting how busy an area of Bobst is. They can report a general amount of seats available, and/or rate how busy a given floor is, as well as reporting how quiet the floor is.

# Scope
The app will have a reporting form and a page for viewing the reported busyness of a section. The app will require a pretty-looking map of the floors of Bobst, with an easy to read gradient of busyness and other factors like noise, potentially with cool transitions between viewing floors. Front-end heavy.
